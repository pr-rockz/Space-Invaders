# Space-Invaders
This is a multilevel game made using the PyGame Module.
A fun game which can be played by children and adults alike. Game currently under developement. If anyone wants to contribute then they are welcome and please contact to me through the contacts given in the profile.

I learned to code this game from FreeCodeCamp. But anyone can copy the code of game from there and change variables, background and other images, music and others things.
What I done new is to have a option of resizing the window and having the option to choose the number of enemies. I have also added the option of taking your spaceship to different altitude but in a retricted manner.

Planning to make more changes. 

Will be pleased to hear some exciting ideas about the project!
Your contribution is more than welcome!!
